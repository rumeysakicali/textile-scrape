## Common Issues

### Issue: "GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY is not set"
**Solution:** Make sure you have created a `.env` file and added your API key.

### Issue: "REQUEST_DENIED"
**Solution:** 
1. Check if Places API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
2. Verify your API key is correct
3. Check if billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project

### Issue: "Zero results"
**Solution:**
- Try increasing the `SEARCH_RADIUS`
- Try a different `SEARCH_LOCATION`
- Use different keywords (e.g., "kuma≈ü", "tekstil", "fabric")

### Issue: No emails sent
**Solution:** 
- Make sure companies have websites in their Google Maps data
- The application automatically extracts emails from company websites
- If a website doesn't contain email addresses, that company will be skipped
- Check the console output to see which emails were found
- Email credentials must be configured in `.env` file

## Advanced Usage

### Email Extraction Feature

The application automatically extracts email addresses from company websites:

**How it works:**
1. For each company found on Google Maps, the app checks if they have a website
2. If a website exists, the app visits multiple pages to find email addresses:
   - Homepage (/)
   - Contact pages (/contact, /contact-us, /contactus, /iletisim)
   - About pages (/about, /about-us, /hakkimizda)
   - Company info pages (/company, /info)
3. Email addresses are extracted from:
   - `mailto:` links
   - Plain text on the page (contact info, footer, etc.)
4. The app prioritizes contact emails like:
   - `info@company.com`
   - `contact@company.com` / `iletisim@company.com` (Turkish)
   - `sales@company.com` / `satis@company.com` (Turkish)
   - `support@company.com` / `destek@company.com` (Turkish)
   - `business@company.com`, `office@company.com`, `admin@company.com`
5. Invalid emails are filtered out (example.com, image files, etc.)
6. Enhanced extraction checks multiple pages to maximize email discovery

**What to expect:**
- Higher success rate in finding emails compared to single-page extraction
- Some websites may not have email addresses ‚Üí company will be skipped
- Some websites may be inaccessible (timeout, DNS errors) ‚Üí logged and skipped
- Email extraction includes delays between requests to be respectful of websites
- The first valid email found (prioritized by type) is used for communication

**Example output:**
```
üîç Extracting email from https://textile-company.com...
üìß Found 3 email(s) on website
‚úâÔ∏è  Found email: info@textile-company.com
```

### Getting More Search Results

**New Feature: Multi-Keyword Search with Pagination**

To maximize the number of companies found, the application now supports:

**1. Pagination (Automatic):**
- The app automatically fetches up to 3 pages of results per keyword
- Google Maps returns ~20 results per page
- Total: Up to 60 results per keyword

**2. Multiple Keywords:**
Add `ADDITIONAL_KEYWORDS` to your `.env` file:
```env
ADDITIONAL_KEYWORDS=textile manufacturer,kuma≈ü imalat,tekstil toptan,fabric wholesale
```

**3. How it works:**
- Each keyword is searched separately with pagination
- Results are combined and duplicates are removed
- Companies are identified by unique place_id

**4. Example Results:**
```
Main keyword: "textile fabric company" ‚Üí 60 results
+ "textile manufacturer" ‚Üí 45 results (15 duplicates removed)
+ "kuma≈ü imalat" ‚Üí 30 results (10 duplicates removed)
+ "tekstil toptan" ‚Üí 25 results (8 duplicates removed)
= Total: 152 unique companies!
```

**5. Console Output:**
```
Searching with 4 keyword(s)...

üîç Searching for: "textile fabric company"
    Page 1 complete, fetching next page...
    Page 2 complete, fetching next page...
